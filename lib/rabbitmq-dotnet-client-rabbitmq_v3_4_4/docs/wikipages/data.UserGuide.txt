** Introduction

The RabbitMQ .NET client is an implementation of an AMQP client library for C#
(and, implicitly, other .NET languages), and a binding exposing AMQP
services via Microsoft's Windows Communication Foundation (WCF).

This is the User Guide for the RabbitMQ .NET client library. It
provides an overview of the codebase and the implemented API.

The full details of the API are documented separately, in the
NDocProc-generated javadoc-like HTML documentation.

** AMQP dialects implemented

The client library implements AMQP specifications version 0-8, 0-8bis
(0-8 as modified by QPid for their M2 release), 0-9 (omitting
sections of the specification marked "work in progress", i.e. the
[code Message] content-class) and 0-9-1. The ApiGen tool processes the
specification XML files in conjunction with certain C# interfaces,
generating C# code directly, which is compiled into the final
assembly.
