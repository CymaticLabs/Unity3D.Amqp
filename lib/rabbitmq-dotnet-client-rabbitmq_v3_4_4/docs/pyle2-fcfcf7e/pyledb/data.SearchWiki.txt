Use the following form to search Wiki page titles and text:

@html
  <form method="get" action="_/search">
    <input type="text" name="q" size="30" />
    <input type="submit" value="Search Page Titles and Text" />
  </form>

(The text field at the top right of each page, in the header area of the page, is an interface to the same search feature.)

Search in pyle2 differs from the search that was implemented in pyle1:

 - use a space-separated list of words to search for.
 - regular expressions are [i not] supported

Pages will appear in the results list if one or more of the keywords searched for appears in the page title, or in the page text.

 - Pages that match in the page title are listed in [b bold].
 - The number after each page title is the total number of occurrences of the keywords searched for.
 - Pages with a higher occurrence count appear earlier in the result list.
