Pyle is a WikiClone - an implementation of a program sharing general
ideas with the original WikiWiki developed by Ward Cunningham.

Pyle is written entirely in Python, and is released under the GNU
GeneralPublicLicense.

This wiki ships with a few pages of content by default, including:

 - InstallationGuide, which shows you how to install and configure Pyle
 - RecentChanges, which shows you the most recent changes made in the wiki
 - PluginDetails, where you can get help on the installed plugins
 - SearchWiki, where you can learn about searching the wiki content
 - MarkupSyntax, where you can learn about the syntax used for various kinds of markup in Pyle pages
 - SandBox, a scratch page where you can experiment with syntax.

There is also [link _/sitemap|a sitemap] available, automatically
generated from the link structure in the wiki's content.
